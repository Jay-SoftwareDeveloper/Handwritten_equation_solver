# AI-Based Handwritten Equation Solver ðŸ§ ðŸ§®

This is a simple and interactive Streamlit web app that helps you solve handwritten linear or quadratic equations. Just upload an image of your handwritten equationâ€”the app will read it using OCR (powered by Tesseract), process it, and solve it step-by-step using SymPy.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload an image of a handwritten equation
- Automatically processes the image using OpenCV
- Uses Tesseract to extract the text (OCR)
- Solves both linear and quadratic equations
- Shows the step-by-step solution using SymPy so you can understand how it's done

## ðŸ›  Installation
```bash
1. Clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-equation-solver.git
2. Navigate to the folder: cd handwritten-equation-solver
3. Install: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## ðŸ”§ Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- streamlit
- opencv-python
- pytesseract
- numpy
- sympy
- pillow

Donâ€™t forget: Tesseract OCR must be installed on your system and added to your system PATH for this to work correctly.

#### Important
- The project was initially hosted on a GitHub account linked to my college email (COG domain), which has since been deleted. I've now reuploaded it here on my new GitHub to preserve and showcase the work.
